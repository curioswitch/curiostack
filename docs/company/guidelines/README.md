# Guidelines

Here are some general guidelines that can be applied to the entire company or specific teams. They 
are just that, guidelines, not rules, and are intended to create a consistent set of best practices 
that maximize output. While such guidelines should never be inputted into, e.g., a performance
review process, everyone should be encouraged to follow them where possible to make sure everyone is
going through the same processes and can work together most effectively.
