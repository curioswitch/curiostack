# curiostack
Full stack to help satisfy curiosity

## Company Resources

Looking for guidelines and documents outlining best practices for designing a company, not just the
engineering codebase? Check out our resources [here](./docs/company) which can hopefully help.

## Set up

See gradle-curiostack-plugin [README](tools/gradle-plugins/gradle-curiostack-plugin/README.md) for setting up the gradle plugins.

## Developing

Curiostack only requires `bash`.

First run

```bash
$ ./gradlew :setup
```

to set up all required tools, by downloading openjdk, python, gcloud, node, golang, etc, and inserting a PATH setting into zshrc and bashrc. There won't be any version conflicts between e.g., system-installed nodejs and gradle-installed nodejs as gradle-installed nodejs will be the one on the path when running Gradle invocations. In addition, any `bash` invocations of commands when inside the repository will use the managed tool. Outside the repository, system tools will be used as normal.

### IDE
Curiostack only has a dependency on Java. However, IntelliJ is highly recommended for development.
The free community edition is sufficient for Java development, while the pro edition may provide a
more integrated IDE for both server and client development. Many users will choose to use IntelliJ
community edition for server side development and Atom or Visual Studio Code for client side.

To work on IntelliJ, clone the repository and in a command line, run

```
$ ./gradlew idea
```

to generate initial IntelliJ configuration. Then open up the folder in IntelliJ and say yes when it
asks you to link the project.

All code-style, license, etc setup will be done automatically, and you're ready to code.
