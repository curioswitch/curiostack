# An image that inherits from itself. Any files stored outside the working directory volume, like
# dependency jars, will be saved into the image. By rebuilding itself before any build of the
# repository, dependency jars can be cached continuously.

# TODO(choko): Define a condition to clear and recreate the cache from scratch. The smartest
# approach would look at the current source repositories dependencies and compare with the cached
# dependencies, a basic approach would be to store the original build timestamp and look at it
